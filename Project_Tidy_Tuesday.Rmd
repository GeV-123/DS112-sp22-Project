We found this dataset in Kaggle. It is not a real dataset, but a dataset that is made by a company to mimic the real life situation of employee's income. Thus, there is no NA in the dataset and I hope use the below plot to have a general view towards the distribution of income and to see if there is any difference in the income received based on gender. 


```{r, fig.alt= "The monthly income distributions in the dataset using a density plot with the blue line showing the mean monthly income for all workers" }
 Employee %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = MonthlyIncome)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), color = "#E95C20FF", fill = "#F0B67F", bins = 40) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(MonthlyIncome)), color = "#4F2C1DFF", size = 1.5) +
  geom_density(alpha=.5, fill="#006747FF") + 
  labs(title = "Monthly Income Distributions", 
       subtitle = "Histogram Plot",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL)
```
```{r}
Employee_dep <- Employee %>%
  group_by(Department) %>%
  mutate(ave_income_dep = mean(MonthlyIncome))

 Employee_dep %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = MonthlyIncome, color = Gender)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, alpha = 0.8 ) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ave_income_dep)), color = "#4F2C1DFF", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Department)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Female" = "#E95C20FF",
                                "Male"="#006747FF")) + 
  labs(title = "Monthly Income Distributions by department", 
       subtitle = "Histogram Plot",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL)
 
```


```{r}
 Employee_dep %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = MonthlyIncome, color = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.2 ) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ave_income_dep)), color = "#4F2C1DFF", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(vars (Department)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Female" = "#E95C20FF",
                                "Male"="#006747FF")) +
